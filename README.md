## Notes 

- The header background is animated to change colors every few seconds (for awesomeness!)
- In mobile format the nav bar is intentionally not fixed to the top as that would be counterintuitive for the user 
- Once scrolling you can use the little arrow button on the bottom right to navigate back to the top of the page
- You can click on the flag, retweet, or like button of each tweet to change their color to blue
